This is the codes to compute the maximal solutions given a file and a list of thresholds.

	- hypergraph.py: code
	- main.py: a simple example to use the code

Please find the usage of "hypergraph.py" by checking "main.py".

The file "test_output.txt" is generated by:
	python main.py celltissue.csv > test_output.txt

Please notice that the ordering of the obtained maximal solutions may differ every time,
since the data structure set() is used.
